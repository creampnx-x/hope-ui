# Learn the basics

Get familiar with core Hope UI concepts by building a simple `Card` component.

<Preview isFullRounded>
  <CardTutorialFinal />

## The process

### Layout components

First, we define the structure of the `Card` using two layout components from Hope UI:

- **Box:** The most abstract Hope UI component, it basically a `div` with superpowers.
- **Flex:** A Box with `display: flex`.

```tsx
import { Box, Flex } from "@hope-ui/core";

export function Card() {
  return (
    <Flex>
      <img src="https://bit.ly/3TIBe7N" alt="Reunion Island" />
      <Box>
        <Flex>
          <span>Reunion Island</span>
          <Flex>
            <span>Nature</span>
          </Flex>
        </Flex>
        <p>
          La Reunion, previously Ile Bourbon; is an island in the Indian Ocean that is an overseas
          department and region of France.
        </p>
        <button>Learn more</button>
      </Box>
    </Flex>
  );
}
```

### Typography components

We are using native HTML elements like `span` and `p` to render our text content. Let's replace them by one of Hope UI's typography components: `Text`.

`Text` renders a `p` tag by default and come with a `size` prop that we can use to adjust the size of the text will keep it legible.

Also, since it's a built-in Hope UI component it will also make our life easier when it comes to styling later on.

```tsx {0,8,10-12,15-18}
import { Box, Flex, Text } from "@hope-ui/core";

export function Card() {
  return (
    <Flex>
      <img src="https://bit.ly/3TIBe7N" alt="Reunion Island" />
      <Box>
        <Flex>
          <Text as="span">Reunion Island</Text>
          <Flex>
            <Text as="span" size="xs">
              Nature
            </Text>
          </Flex>
        </Flex>
        <Text size="sm">
          La Reunion, previously Ile Bourbon; is an island in the Indian Ocean that is an overseas
          department and region of France.
        </Text>
        <button>Learn more</button>
      </Box>
    </Flex>
  );
}
```

<Callout>
  Notice the use of the `as` prop on the first two `Text` components which allows changing the
  rendered DOM element.
</Callout>

### More built-in components

We are using a native HTML `button` at the bottom of our `Card`, which looks not that good. Let's replace it by one more built-in Hope UI component, the `Button`.

```tsx {0,19-21}
import { Box, Button, Flex, Text } from "@hope-ui/core";

export function Card() {
  return (
    <Flex>
      <img src="https://bit.ly/3TIBe7N" alt="Reunion Island" />
      <Box>
        <Flex>
          <Text as="span">Reunion Island</Text>
          <Flex>
            <Text as="span" size="xs">
              Nature
            </Text>
          </Flex>
        </Flex>
        <Text size="sm">
          La Reunion, previously Ile Bourbon; is an island in the Indian Ocean that is an overseas
          department and region of France.
        </Text>
        <Button variant="soft" colorScheme="primary" isFullWidth>
          Learn more
        </Button>
      </Box>
    </Flex>
  );
}
```

### Make it looks good

Now the fun part, Styling! Hope UI uses the concept of _"Style Props"_ popularized by [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/style-props) which allows us to apply styles simply by passing props to our components.

```tsx {5-11,14-16,18-25,30-32,38,42}
import { Box, Button, Flex, Text } from "@hope-ui/core";

function Card() {
  return (
    <Flex
      flexDirection="column"
      border={vars => `1px solid ${vars.colors.neutral["200"]}`}
      borderRadius="lg"
      boxShadow="lg"
      width="full"
      maxWidth={96}
      overflow="clip"
    >
      <img src="https://bit.ly/3TIBe7N" alt="Reunion Island" />
      <Box padding={5}>
        <Flex justifyContent="space-between" alignItems="center" width="full" marginBottom={2}>
          <Text fontWeight="semibold">Reunion Island</Text>
          <Flex
            paddingLeft={2}
            paddingRight={2}
            paddingTop={1}
            paddingBottom={1}
            alignItems="center"
            backgroundColor="success.50"
            color="success.800"
            borderRadius="full"
          >
            <Text
              as="span"
              size="xs"
              lineHeight="none"
              fontWeight="semibold"
              textTransform="uppercase"
            >
              Nature
            </Text>
          </Flex>
        </Flex>
        <Text size="sm" color="neutral.500" marginBottom={3}>
          La Reunion, previously Ile Bourbon; is an island in the Indian Ocean that is an overseas
          department and region of France.
        </Text>
        <Button variant="soft" colorScheme="primary" isFullWidth marginTop={3}>
          Learn more
        </Button>
      </Box>
    </Flex>
  );
}
```

### Understanding theme tokens

All style props above are pretty much self-explanatory, however some values are weird like:

- `color="success.800"`
- `width="full"`
- `paddingRight={2}`
- `border={vars => '1px solid ${vars.colors.neutral["200"]}'}`

This is what we call _"Theme Tokens"_, a set of values (colors, spacing, shadows, etc...) that we can refer to when styling to keep our design consistent.

We can refer to them directly as value of our style props or use the _"function form"_ (like for the `border` prop above) which gives us access to all available tokens through the `vars` object.

### Write less, do more

Our `Card` component is pretty good now, but we can save some typing by using Hope UI _"shorthand"_ style props.

```tsx {5,7-10,14-15,18-23,36,40}
import { Box, Button, Flex, Text } from "@hope-ui/core";

function Card() {
  return (
    <Flex
      direction="column"
      border={vars => `1px solid ${vars.colors.neutral["200"]}`}
      rounded="lg"
      shadow="lg"
      w="full"
      maxW={96}
      overflow="clip"
    >
      <img src="https://bit.ly/3TIBe7N" alt="Reunion Island" />
      <Box p={5}>
        <Flex justify="space-between" align="center" w="full" mb={2}>
          <Text fontWeight="semibold">Reunion Island</Text>
          <Flex
            px={2}
            py={1}
            align="center"
            bgColor="success.50"
            color="success.800"
            rounded="full"
          >
            <Text
              as="span"
              size="xs"
              lineHeight="none"
              fontWeight="semibold"
              textTransform="uppercase"
            >
              Nature
            </Text>
          </Flex>
        </Flex>
        <Text size="sm" color="neutral.500" mb={3}>
          La Reunion, previously Ile Bourbon; is an island in the Indian Ocean that is an overseas
          department and region of France.
        </Text>
        <Button variant="soft" colorScheme="primary" isFullWidth mt={3}>
          Learn more
        </Button>
      </Box>
    </Flex>
  );
}
```

## Summary
