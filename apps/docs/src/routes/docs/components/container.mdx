import { Box, Container } from "@hope-ui/core";

import { Preview } from "~/components/preview";

# Container

Constrain a content's width to the current breakpoint, while keeping it fluid.

## Import

```ts
import { Container } from "@hope-ui/core";
```

## Usage

<Preview>
  <Container>
    Yosemite National Park is an American national park in California, surrounded on the southeast
    by Sierra National Forest and on the northwest by Stanislaus National Forest.
  </Container>
</Preview>

```tsx
<Container>
  Yosemite National Park is an American national park in California, surrounded on the southeast by
  Sierra National Forest and on the northwest by Stanislaus National Forest.
</Container>
```

### Centering the container

By default, the container is centered within its parent with a margin `auto` on left and right, you can disable this behavior by setting the `isCentered` prop to `false.

<Preview isCentered={false}>
  <Container p={4} bg="royalblue" color="white" maxW="xl" isCentered={false}>
    Yosemite National Park is an American national park in California, surrounded on the southeast
    by Sierra National Forest and on the northwest by Stanislaus National Forest.
  </Container>
</Preview>

```tsx
<Container p={4} bg="royalblue" color="white" maxW="xl" isCentered={false}>
  Yosemite National Park is an American national park in California, surrounded on the southeast by
  Sierra National Forest and on the northwest by Stanislaus National Forest.
</Container>
```

### Centering the children

In some cases, the width of the content can be smaller than the container's width, you can use the `centerContent` prop to center the content.

<Preview isCentered={false}>
  <Container bg="dodgerblue" centerContent>
    <Box p={4} bg="royalblue" color="white" maxW="xl">
      Yosemite National Park is an American national park in California, surrounded on the southeast
      by Sierra National Forest and on the northwest by Stanislaus National Forest.
    </Box>
  </Container>
</Preview>

```tsx
<Container bg="dodgerblue" centerContent>
  <Box p={4} bg="royalblue" color="white" maxW="xl">
    Yosemite National Park is an American national park in California, surrounded on the southeast
    by Sierra National Forest and on the northwest by Stanislaus National Forest.
  </Box>
</Container>
```
